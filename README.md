# QuestModInstaller
A tool that patches Unity IL2CPP applications on the Oculus/Meta Quest platform. Designed with modularity and compatibility in mind.

### What sets it apart from [BMBF](https://bmbf.dev/) and [QuestPatcher](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/QuestPatcher)?
QMI is designed to make it easy to install mods for any game. This includes a plugin library, allowing the application to be easily customised and modified to suit each game and each user. This may include plugins that automatically install for a certain game to help already existing mods and their required assets to be installed easily, or even a custom theme.
